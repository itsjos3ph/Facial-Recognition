<h1>Facial Recognition System</h1>
This project demonstrates a real-time facial recognition system using Python, numpy, and face_recognition. 
It identifies faces from webcam input and matches them against provided sample images or a custom attendance folder.
<br>

<h2>If you want access to the images I used, download the zip file. Only the two python files will be showcased as I cannot share image files.</h2>

<h2>Features</h2>
Simple Demonstration: Match faces from two provided sample images.
Attendance System: Recognize faces using a webcam and log recognized individuals based on a custom image folder.

<h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
1. Download the Project: Download the ZIP file containing the project files (Python scripts and sample images).

2. Extract the ZIP File: Extract the contents to your desired location. The folder will include:

- basic.py
- attendance_project.py
- ImagesBasic folder (contains two sample images)
- ImagesAttendance folder (for custom attendance use)

3. Add Your Photo (for attendance system): Place a clear photo of yourself in the attendance_images folder. This is required to log your presence during the webcam-based demonstration.

*ps: make sure you have numpy and face_recognition installed, you may need to install an older version of numpy*
